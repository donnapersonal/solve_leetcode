# 414.Third Maximum Number

## LeetCode 题目链接

[414.第三大的数](https://leetcode.cn/problems/third-maximum-number/)

## 题目大意

给你一个非空数组，返回此数组中第三大的数 。如果不存在，则返回数组中最大的数

```js
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2.
The third distinct maximum is 1.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 2.
The second distinct maximum is 1.
The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [2,2,3,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2 (both 2's are counted together since they have the same value).
The third distinct maximum is 1.
```

限制:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1

## 解题

思路：一次遍历 + 三个变量追踪（不排序）

可以用三个变量：`first`、`second`、`third` 来维护三个不同的最大值，从大到小排列：
- 遍历数组时更新这三个变量
- 如果当前数等于其中某一个最大值，就跳过（保证“不同”）

```js
var thirdMax = function(nums) {
    let first = null, second = null, third = null;

    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num === first || num === second || num === third) continue;

        if (first === null || num > first) {
            third = second;
            second = first;
            first = num;
        } else if (second === null || num > second) {
            third = second;
            second = num;
        } else if (third === null || num > third) {
            third = num;
        }
    }

    return third !== null ? third : first;
};
```
```python
class Solution:
    def thirdMax(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        first = second = third = None
        for num in nums:
            if num == first or num == second or num == third:
                continue
            if first is None or num > first:
                third = second
                second = first
                first = num
            elif second is None or num > second:
                third = second
                second = num
            elif third is None or num > third:
                third = num
        return third if third is not None else first
```

- 时间复杂度：`O(n)`，其中 `n` 是数组 `nums` 的长度
- 空间复杂度：`O(1)`
